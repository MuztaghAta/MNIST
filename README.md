# MNIST
This is a well-known toy project, I play it for learning the book 'Neural Networks and Deep Learning' by Michael Nielsen. 

The codes is written for Python 3.6. I wrote (not copy for the book) most of the codes by myself to see whether my own codes works, and more importantly I want to improve my coding skill by comparing my codes with the codes provided in the book. Besides, coding line by line really helps understand the theory of neural networks since you have to recall the theory many times when writing the codes.

I created a main script 'train.py' that loads the mnist data, specifies hyperparameters and trains the network. I also did some changes to the module of 'mnist_loader' so that data path can be specified in 'train.py'.
