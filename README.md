This is a well-known toy project, I play it for learning the book 'Neural Networks and Deep Learning' by Michael Nielsen.

I wrote (not copy) most of the codes to see whether my own codes work, and more importantly I want to improve my coding skill by
comparing my codes with the codes provided in the book. Besides, coding line by line really helps understand the theory of neural networks
since you have to recall the theory many times when writing the codes.
